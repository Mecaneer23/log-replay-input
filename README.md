# Log and Replay Keyboard and Mouse Events

## How to use this repository

N/A currently

## TODO

- I still haven't added scroll functionality to replay
- I need to add a 'null' keypress and a 'null' mouse click. Without this, it starts executing from the start of time, without accounting for any time nothing happens. In order for anything to happen, a key must be pressed, or the mouse must be engaged(moving, clicking, etc.)
